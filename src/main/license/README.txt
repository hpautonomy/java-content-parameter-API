Autonomy Content Parameter API

This API is for representing aspects of IDOL's Content server, including
FieldText and document References. It has a dependency on the Autonomy ACI
Client API. All third-party JAR dependencies of this API are also dependencies
of that API, so they are not explicitly listed here.
