/**
 * Interface for representing IDOL sort expressions. An example expression might be:
 *
 * <pre>
 * relevance+MYFIELD:increasing
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@link SortBuilder} class can be used to combine sort expressions into more complex expressions. However, it is
 * often unnecessary to explicitly instantiate a {@link SortBuilder} as the {@code Sort} interface forces all specifiers
 * to provide support for combining expressions.
 * <p/>
 * {@link SortBy} provides static fields and methods for working with the most common sort specifiers.
 * </p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Sort sort = SortBy.RELEVANCE.then(SortBy.increasing("MYFIELD"));</pre>
 *
 * This becomes even simpler using static imports:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Sort sort = RELEVANCE.then(increasing("MYFIELD"));
 * </pre>
